FAQ
============
**Q: Hey, there's no fookin' code 'er, mate!**

*A: I know, my cockney brethren. It's because we recently had a HUGE code overhaul, and I am going to put the new code up after I wake up today.*

**Q: This thing is stupid.**

*A: This isn't a question.* 

**Q: How do I request a feature?** 

*A: Simple. send a message on reddit to /u/stanism_prophet with the subject "New Feature".* 
   *This will alert me, seeing as I'm the only dev currently, and I'll probably flip a coin*
   *to see if I'll implement your feature or not. It'll be completely random, and therefore, fair.*
   
    ============<Easier way>============
   
    Find any comment sent by /u/stanism_prophet 
    and click the link titled "Want a Feature?" 
    and fill out the info in the message body.

**Q: Where can I view the sourc--**

*A: I'm going to stop you right there and let you look around the website you're already on for a bit.*

**Q: It's 05:34 in your timezone and you haven't slept yet, and nobody has actually asked you any questions?**

*A: Yes, and yes. I'm anticipating. It's what innovators do. Nobody knew they wanted an automated and* 
   *psuedo-randomized stanism macro bot either, but they did. ANTICIPATION, SAHN.*
